          <p class="art-paragraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed
            up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
            physics.</p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
            exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered
            what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
            course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
            exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
            for a prodigiously violent instant. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
            the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
            enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles
            were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
            page and drew a double box around it. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
            reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
            known undramatically as inflation, looked right. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M.
            Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric
            of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
            proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
            though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or
            of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
            science and speculation. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
            extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is
            only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
            unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
            universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over. </p>

          <h3> ‘As Big as It Gets’ </h3>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and
            yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
            observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general
            relativity, should ruffle space-time. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
            bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe
            when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
            as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their
            results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a
            set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal. </p>

          <h4> The Theory of Inflation </h4>
          <figcaption> Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which
            explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the
            Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. </figcaption>

          <div class="graphic">
            <img src="./assets/theory.png" />
            <p class=" info1 first-row"><strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years
              old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now
              about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the
              universe has an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="info2 first-row"><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old
              enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to
              the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to
              mix into an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="info3 first-row"><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine
              using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the
              amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>
            <p class="info4 first-row"><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a
              mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
              temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you
              might want to look for another explanation.</p>
            <p class="info5 second-row"><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been
              enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all
              the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time,
              that might explain their even temperature.</p>
            <p class="info6 second-row"><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory
              proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe
              expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding
              energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
            <p class="info7 second-row"><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected
              evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic
              background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are
              gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
            <p class="info8 second-row"><strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine
              a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature
              as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe
              mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a
            definite confirmation in his lifetime.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations
            and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts
            of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night
            in 1979), in his office last week.

            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr.

            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we
            did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order
            it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
            hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he
            said.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen
            and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays
            true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a
            competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
            “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the
            clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep
            result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
            confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
            temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck
            satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
            findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from
            balloons, mountaintops and space.
          </p>

          <h3> Spirals in the Sky </h3>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
            the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert
            Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of
            four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio
            telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing
            conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of
            the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr.
            Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been
            hooked ever since,” he said.

          <figcaption>The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint
            spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
            at its birth.

        <article class="article-body">
          <p class="art-paragraph">
            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was
            polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction
            rather than another.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
            inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as
            they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said.
            As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in
            spirals.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the
            temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant
            superconducting thermometer.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up
            time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that
            competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
          </p>

          <h3>A Special Time</h3>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying
            up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the
            evolution of the universe.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism,
            and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply
            different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its
            earliest, hottest moments.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some
            old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
            evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            That was where Dr. Guth came in.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls
            below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze,
            releasing latent heat.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph"> Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
            state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent
            energy. </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
            antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying
            the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
            trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a
            grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
            radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable
            universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that
            there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might
            be the ultimate free lunch.”
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s
            original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own
            universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will
            continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
            multiverse.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
            going any deeper into the past.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
            inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the
            primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer
