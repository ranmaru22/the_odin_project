          <p class="art-paragraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed
            up late with his notebook and
            equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
            have been
            created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
            begin with.
            A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a
            special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than
            the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
            from pole to
            pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
            wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
            like spit
            in the ocean.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double
            box around
            it.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
            the beginning
            of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
            right.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
            telescopes at the
            South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
            for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
            waves — the
            signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth
            of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
            evidence of
            inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr.
            Guth,
            wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the
            recent
            discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
            open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
            light-years in space
            with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
            cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there
            might be an
            endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta
            water boiling
            over.

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
            forever beyond
            the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s
            ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according
            to Einstein’s
            theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part
            of the
            team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram
            encoded in
            gravitational waves.”
          </p>

          <p class="art-paragraph">
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave
            radiation that
            permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
            and as hot as
            the surface of the sun.

            The Theory of Inflation
          </h4>
          <figcaption>
            Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how
            the universe
            expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion
            years ago.

          <div class="graphic">
            <p class="info1 first-row">THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our
              position in
              the Milky Way galaxy, we can
              observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
              mystery. Wherever we
              look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="info2 first-row">NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to
              have
              traveled the vast distance from one
              side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
              patches of hot
              and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="info3 first-row">COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the
              other
              direction. You see a similar coffee
              cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
              in every
              direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
            <p class="info4 first-row">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry
              coffee
              cups from place to place before
              they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee
              pot, all at the
              same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>

            <p class="info5 second-row">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to
              carry coffee
              cups from place to place before
              they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee
              pot, all at the
              same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
            <p class="info6 second-row">INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that,
              less than a
              trillionth of a second after
              the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
              the violently
              expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
              universe.</p>
            <p class="info7 second-row">FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
              ancient
              fluctuations in swirls of
              polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
              early
              universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
            <p class="info8 second-row">EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central
              pot
              expanding faster than light and
              cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
              the structure of
              the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
